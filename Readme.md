# Express Mongo Starter App

## Purpose

This is a starter app for creating [Express](http://expressjs.com/) applications with basic sign up and sessions, using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) to store objects and sessions in [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).  Lots of stuff taken from Pedro Teixeira's [Node Tuts](http://www.nodetuts.com/) series.

## Installation

Express 1.0.8 requires Node.js 0.2.x

Install the following via [npm](http://www.npmjs.org/):

* express@1.0.8
* mongoose@1.1.2
* stylus@0.4.0

MongoDB is also required.

## TODO

* err.... tests
* check that login is a valid email address
* spam sign up prevention, e.g. send a confirmation email
